While Java development is my primary language, I am always eager to understand all aspects of a system.

I was fortunate enough to know from a young age that I like computers - not just playing games but learn how computer programs actually work. Thus, programming came naturally.

I like to build things that will help people in their everyday lives and make them happy.

I believe

<strong>&gt;</strong> Make someone happy today (me)<br>
<strong>&gt;</strong> Build software for people first, computers second.<br>
<strong>&gt;</strong> Usability comes first, inspired by Donald Norman<br>
<strong>&gt;</strong> Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler. (Albert Einstein)<br>
<strong>&gt;</strong> Donâ€™t make me think. (Steve Krug)<br>
<strong>&gt;</strong> People who think well, write well. (David Ogilvy)<br>
<strong>&gt;</strong> Omit needless words. (Strunk & White)<br>
<strong>&gt;</strong> Do one thing and do it right. (37signals)<br>
<strong>&gt;</strong> Good is the enemy of great. (Jim Collins)<br>
<strong>&gt;</strong> Stay hungry, stay foolish. (Steve Jobs)<br>
<strong>&gt;</strong> Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage (Anais Nin)<br>
<strong>&gt;</strong> Michael Jordan is an alien. (me, again)<br>

I am an adventurer, a traveller, and a student. I love to learn and experience new things daily.
